Therapeutic and diagnostic potential of targeting microRNAs in autism,"The study seeks to understand the mechanism of how parental and gestational exposure to environmental factors contribute to autism. Based on preliminary evidence, we hypothesize that the transgenerational transmission of autism traits is programmed by small non-coding RNAs such as microRNA. In this study, we will define the microRNA expression signature in a mouse model of Maternal-Immune-Activation (MIA)-induced autism, and interrogate a functional role for microRNA dysregulation in autism.",,,University of Virginia,University of Virginia,,,,Study In Progress,Anindya Dutta,"Ph.D., Professor, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics",University of Virginia,,John Lukens,"Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Department of Neuroscience",University of Virginia,,Zhangli Su,"Ph.D., Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics",University of Virginia,,Assessment and Diagnosis,Treatment and Therapies,Genetic Conditions,,,,,All Ages

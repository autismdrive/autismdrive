  <h1>Mirrored Server</h1>
  <p>
    This server is currently running in a mirrored mode and provides access to de-identified data. It is pulling data
    from the main/public server on a regular basis. Because this is acting as a mirror of the public facing system this
    data should not be modified. The following areas of the site are currently disabled:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Profile Page</b>: Which would allow the creation of new participants. This should be done on the main public
      facing site.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Questionnaires / Flow</b>: Which would create additional data that could be overwritten, lost, or contradict
      information taken from the main system.
    </li>
  </ul>
